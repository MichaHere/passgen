# PassGen: A Simple Password Generator
This is a simple password generator that allows the user to generate a password of any length and some specified character types. 

## Dependencies
* InquirerPy
* Colorama
* Python

## Install
To use PassGen, you can simply clone this GitHub repository to your computer, install the dependencies, and run the `passgen.py` file with Python. 

Alternatively, if you want to use the script as a command in the Linux terminal, you can make a file in your `/usr/bin/` directory called `passgen`. Make sure you start the file with `#!` followed by the path to your Python installation. For example:

    #!/usr/bin/python3

After this line, simply paste in the content of the `passgen.py` file and run the command by typing the filename, in this case `passgen`.
